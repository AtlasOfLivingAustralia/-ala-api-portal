# Introduction

The Atlas of Living Australia (ALA) is Australia’s national biodiversity database. It is a collaborative, digital infrastructure that aggregates Australian biodiversity data from multiple sources, making the information open, accessible and reusable. The ALA delivers trusted data services for Australia, supporting world-class biodiversity research and decision-making. 

These data stored in the ALA have been fully parsed, processed and augmented with consistent taxonomic, geolocation and climate/environmental data. Our data API provides access to over 100 million species occurrence records as well as taxonomic and scientific name information for over 153,000 species, complete with geospatial, taxonomic and temporal searching & filtering as well as bulk downloads for use ‘offline’. 

# API Portfolio Hub 

Welcome to the ALA API Portfolio Hub.  

We’ve recently moved to this API Gateway to streamline access and improve security for end-users by incorporating user authentication. ALA data is still open and freely accessible. 


 
For more information or assistance, please contact support@ala.org.au. 

API Endpoint: https://apis.ala.org.au

# Authentication

Most of the ALA APIs are publicly accessible and do not required authentication. For the API endpoints that are protected a JWT access token is used to authenticate requests.

Open ID connect is used to obtain an access token, once an access token is obtained it should be passed as a bearer token in the HTTP Authentication header.

`Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`

We support multiple ways to obtain an access token:
 
 - [Client Credentials](#client-credentials)
 - [Authentication Code Flow](#authentication-code-flow)
 - [Implicit Flow](#implicit-flow)

 Which authenitcation method should I use?

 Anytime the the system is not concerned with end user identity then [Client Credentials](#client-credentials) should be used. The use case would be a headless client application that does not have the ability for user interaction. In this case the system may need to be authentcated however an end user will not.

 If the end user does need to be authenticated then either [Authentication Code Flow](#authentication-code-flow) or [Implicit Flow](#implicit-flow). The consideration as to which authentication flow should be used can be determined if the application client is public or private. For private client application (eg. server side web application) [Authentication Code Flow](#authentication-code-flow) is the most suitable as is both authenticated the end user and the client application. For public client applications (eg. SPA app or javascript application) [Implicit Flow](#implicit-flow) is more suitable as the access_token is returned directly to the client without the secure exchange of the authentication code for the access_token needed with the [Authentication Code Flow](#authentication-code-flow).

You will need a `clientId` and possible `clientSecret` in order to authenticate. Please contact support@ala.org.au to obtain these.

See: [https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow)

See [OIDC Authentication for R](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/openeo/html/OIDCAuth.html)

## Client Credentials

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# Exchange the client credentials (client ID & secret) for an access token
curl --user {clientId}:{clientSecret}  -X POST -d 'grant_type=client_credentials' -d 'scope={scope}' https://ala-test.auth.ap-southeast-2.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/token

# Use the access_token in the Authorization header
curl "api_endpoint_here" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}"
```

```python
import http.client

conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection("")

payload = "grant_type=client_credentials&scope={scope}"

headers = { 
  'Authorization': 'Basic {}'.format(base64.b64encode(bytes(f"{clientId}:{clientSecret}","utf-8")).decode("ascii"))
  'content-type': "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" 
}

conn.request("POST", "https://ala-test.auth.ap-southeast-2.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/token", payload, headers)

res = conn.getresponse()
data = res.read()

print(data.decode("utf-8"))
```

>

The Client Credentials grant type is used for machine to machine authentication where no there is no user interation.

`POST <%= I18n.t(:authBaseUrl) %>/token`

Header Parameters:

Parameter | Mandetory | Default | Description
--------- | --------- | ------- | -----------
Authorization | Y | | base64 encoded `<clientId>:<clientSecret>`
Content-Type | Y | | `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

Request Parameters:

Parameter | Mandetory | Default | Description
--------- | --------- | ------- | -----------
grant_type | Y | | Set to `client_credentials`
scope | N | | A space separated list of scopes that have been approved for the API Authorization client. These scopes will be included in the Access Token that is returned.

## Authentication Code Flow

>
The postman http client supports the authorisation code flow. When configured the user will be prompted to authenticate prior to accessing a protected API enpoint.<br><br>
![](postman-authentication-code.png)

>

`GET <%= I18n.t(:authBaseUrl) %>/authorize`

Request Parameters:

Parameter | Mandetory | Default | Description
--------- | --------- | ------- | -----------
response_type | Y | | Set to `code`
client_id | Y | | the client id
scope | N | | A space separated list of scopes that have been approved for the API Authorization client. These scopes will be included in the Access Token that is returned.
redirect_uri | Y | | The URL where the authentication server redirects the browser after the user is authorizes.
code_challenge_method | N | | Set to `S256` if using PKCE
code_challenge | N | | the code challenge

`POST <%= I18n.t(:authBaseUrl) %>/token`

Header Parameters:

Parameter | Mandetory | Default | Description
--------- | --------- | ------- | -----------
Authorization | Y | | base64 encoded `<clientId>:<clientSecret>`
Content-Type | Y | | `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

Request Parameters:

Parameter | Mandetory | Default | Description
--------- | --------- | ------- | -----------
grant_type | Y | | Set to `authorization_code`
code | Y | | The authentication code returned from the authentication step
redirect_uri | Y | | The URL where the authentication server redirects the browser after the user is authorizes.
code_verifier | N | | the code challenge if using PKCE

## Implicit Flow

>
The postman http client supports the implicit authorisation flow. When configured the user will be prompted to authenticate prior to accessing a protected API enpoint.<br><br>
![](postman-implicit.png)

>

The Implicit Flow is used for apps that have no “back end” logic on the web server, like a Javascript app.

The Implicit flow presents an authorisation page that will prompt a user for credentials before redirecting to the supplied `redirect_url` with the access_token.

`GET <%= I18n.t(:authBaseUrl) %>/authorize`

Request Parameters:

Parameter | Mandetory | Default | Description
--------- | --------- | ------- | -----------
response_type | Y | | Set to `token`
client_id | Y | | the client id
scope | N | | A space separated list of scopes that have been approved for the API Authorization client. These scopes will be included in the Access Token that is returned.
redirect_uri | Y | | The URL where the authentication server redirects the browser after the user is authorizes.
